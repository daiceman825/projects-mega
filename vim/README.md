### Requirements
vim-gtk

# Description
This vimrc was created so that I can quickly take notes whenever I am working on HTB, TryHackMe, or similar type engagements. 

I use this vimrc with vim-gtk so that I can have keyboard support which allows copy-pasting from vim to a terminal. 

Desert256 is just a generic color file that I happen to like. Can be substituted for any color file available for vim. 

File.test contains demos of all the functionality of the vimrc
